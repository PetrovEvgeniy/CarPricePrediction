# 🚗 CarPricePrediction

CarPricePrediction is a repository dedicated to implementing linear regression for predicting the price of second-hand cars using TensorFlow and Python. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze various features of cars and predict their market value accurately.

## 💡Main Functionality

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine-learning model based on linear regression that can estimate the price of used cars. It involves gathering data on different attributes of cars, such as mileage, model year, hp, and condition, and training a TensorFlow model to make price predictions based on these features.

## 📊 Model Training and Evaluation

The repository includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It demonstrates how to encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Additionally, it provides scripts for training the linear regression model using TensorFlow and evaluating its performance using metrics such as mean squared error.

## 📉 Results and Visualization

After training the model, the repository offers tools for visualizing the results and assessing the model's accuracy. It includes scripts for generating scatter plots, which compare the predicted prices with the actual prices of cars in the test set. These visualizations help users understand the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.

## 📄 Dataset

The repository utilizes a publicly available dataset from Kaggle of used car listings, which includes information about various attributes of cars and their corresponding prices. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankpatel14/second-hand-used-cars-data-set-linear-regression?resource=download). Users can download the dataset from the provided link or use their own dataset for training the model.
